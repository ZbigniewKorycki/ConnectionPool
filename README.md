<h1>Connection Pool</h1>

This Python project introduces a connection pool and scheduler for efficient database connection management. The connection pool dynamically adjusts connection counts, maintains a minimum threshold, and employs a scheduler to enhance overall pool efficiency.

The project includes a test that utilizes multithreading to simulate concurrent database queries, offering a practical demonstration of the connection pool's functionality.
